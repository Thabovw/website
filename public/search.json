However, designing successful social network interventions is a considerable research challenge. In this study, we rely on social network analysis and agent-based simulations to better understand and capitalize on the complex interplay of social networks and health behaviors. More specifically, we investigate criteria for selecting influence agents that can be expected to produce the most successful social network health interventions.Objective: The aim of this study was to test which selection criterion to determine influence agents in a social network intervention resulted in the biggest increase in physical activity in the social network. To test the differences among the selection criteria, a computational model was used to simulate different social network interventions and observe the intervention’s effect on the physical activity of primary and secondary school children within their school classes. As a next step, this study relied on the outcomes of the simulated interventions to investigate whether social network interventions are more effective in some classes than others based on network characteristics.Methods: We used a previously validated agent-based model to understand how physical activity spreads in social networks and who was influencing the spread of behavior. From the observed data of 460 participants collected in 26 school classes, we simulated multiple social network interventions with different selection criteria for the influence agents (ie, in-degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and random influence agents) and a control condition (ie, no intervention). Subsequently, we investigated whether the detected variation of an intervention’s success within school classes could be explained by structural characteristics of the social networks (ie, network density and network centralization).Results: The 1-year simulations showed that social network interventions were more effective compared with the control condition (beta=.30; t100=3.23; P=.001).

The results show that nominated networks provided data for the most participants compared to the other two networks, but in these networks participants had the lowest number of connections with peers. The overlap between the three networks was rather small, indicating that the networks measured different type of connections.

Given the popularity and the networked structure of social media, social network intervention seems to be a promising alternative. In social network interventions, a small group of individuals (influence agents) is selected to promote health behaviors within their social network. This study investigates whether a social network intervention is more effective to promote physical activity, compared to a mass media intervention and no intervention. Adolescents (N = 446; Mage = 11.35, SDage = 1.34; 47% male) were randomly allocated by classroom (N = 26) to one of three conditions: social network intervention, mass media intervention, or control condition. In the social network intervention, 15% of the participants (based on peer nominations) was approached to become an influence agent, who then created several vlogs about physical activity. During the intervention period, participants were able to view the vlogs on a smartphone. In the mass media intervention, participants were exposed to vlogs made by unfamiliar peers (i.e., the vlogs of the social network intervention). The control condition did not receive vlogs about physical activity. All participants received a research smartphone to complete questionnaires and a wrist-worn accelerometer to measure physical activity. There were no differences between the social network intervention and the control condition in the short-term, and an unexpected increase in the control condition compared to the social network intervention in the long-term. No differences between the social network intervention and mass media intervention were observed either. Exploratory analyses suggest that the social network intervention increased the perceived social norm toward physical activity and responses to the vlogs were more positive in the social network intervention than in the mass media intervention. The current study does not provide evidence that a social network intervention is more effective in increasing physical activity in adolescents compared to a mass media or no intervention. However, exploratory results suggest that the social network intervention has a positive effect on the perceived descriptive norm and the responses towards the vlogs. These first results warrant further research to investigate the role of the perceived social norms and the added benefit of using influence agents for social network interventions.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Adolescents","Vlogs"],"title":"Testing a Social Network Intervention using Vlogs to Promote Physical Activity among Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Preprint)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542409200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542409200,"objectID":"21d44c17c2651f9a4b37d48f43c3e041","permalink":"/talk/aruba19/","publishdate":"2018-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/aruba19/","section":"talk","summary":"This talk is part of the MyMovez symposium at the university of Aruba.

Previous attempt to promote physical activity via media interventions have been shown to have little effect. Potentially, interventions can be more effective when utilizing the impact that adolescents have on each other’s physical activity. Social network interventions are an emerging and promising approach to counteract the decline in physical activity, by capitalizing on the influence peers have on youth’s behaviors. In social network interventions, a small group of influential individuals (influence agents) is selected to promote health behaviors within their social network. However, no previous social network intervention study has investigated whether a social network intervention is more effective than a mass media campaign or no intervention. Adolescents (N = 446; Mage = 11.35 (SD = 1.34); 47.31% male) were randomly allocated by classroom (N = 26) to one of three conditions: social network intervention, mass media intervention or control condition. In the social network intervention, 15% of the participants was selected to be an influence based on peer nominations (on closeness centrality) and were asked to create several vlogs about physical activity. During the intervention period, participants in the social network condition were able to view the vlogs on a research smartphone. In the mass media intervention, participants were exposed to vlogs made by unfamiliar peers (i.e., the vlogs of the social network intervention). All participants received a research smartphone to complete questionnaires and a wrist-worn accelerometer to measure physical activity. Mixed effect models were us to account for the clustering of data per participant, per day, and per classroom. The analyses showed that there was an overal increase in physical activity druing the intervention. However, no differences were observed between the social network intervention and the control condition in the short-term, and an unexpected increase in the control condition compared to the social network intervention in the long-term. Also no differences between the social network intervention and mass media intervention were observed. In addition, exploratory analyses suggest that descriptive norms involving physical activity increased in the social network intervention and decreased in the mass media intervention. Also, participants in the social network intervention watched the vlogs more often and for a longer period, than participants in the mass media intervention that. The current study was the first study to test the additional benefit of implementing a social network approach the promote physical activity in adolescents by comparting a social network intervention to a mass media intervention and no intervention. The results do not provide evidence that the social network intervention was more effective in increasing physical activity in adolescents. Compared to other social network interventions, the current study did not train the influence agents how they could promote physical activity in the class, but merely showed them how they could create vlogs. Perhaps, a key factor to the effectiveness of social network interventions is a training of the influence agents.","tags":[],"title":"Promoting Adolescents Physical Activity through Social Network Interventions","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542409200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542409200,"objectID":"9f9d2d579bd66991f43e01ed47a5a03c","permalink":"/talk/prague19/","publishdate":"2018-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/prague19/","section":"talk","summary":"Social network interventions targeted at adolescents can have a substantial effect on their physical activity.

The model was based on evidence from studies applying three dominant theoretical approaches, including planned behavior, social norms, and intrinsic motivation. METHOD:The integrated model was tested with structural equation modeling using four data-collection waves of the MyMovez Project (MyMovez, 2017) in which 953 young adolescents (53.9% girls; Mage = 11.19, SDage = 1.36) participated. Self-reported measures were used to assess young adolescents' fruit, vegetable, and water consumption, self-efficacy, attitude, social norms of parents and peers, behavioral intentions, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS:The analyses revealed that young adolescents' intrinsic motivation to eat fruits and vegetables or drink water predicted changes in their fruit, vegetable, and water consumption. Furthermore, adolescents' perceived descriptive norm of parents (i.e., perception of the prevalence of their parents' water consumption) also predicted changes, but only for water consumption. CONCLUSION:The current findings show that young adolescents' intrinsic motivation (and, to some extent, parental social norms) is the strongest predictor of their consumption of fruit, vegetables, and water. It is important to note, behavioral intentions do not predict their actual behavior over time. Consequently, interventions should focus on increasing young adolescents' intrinsic motivation to perform the targeted behavior while incorporating the influence of the social context.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Smartphones","Centrality"],"title":"An integrated model of fruit, vegetable, and water intake in young adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Ketelaar","S Bernritter","TJ van Woudenberg","E Rozendaal","R Konig","J Vantriet","A Hühn","MS van Gisbergen","L Janssen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533074400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533074400,"objectID":"9bd4444de45d4368b87b3c5ee6c4c78d","permalink":"/publication/open_vr/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/open_vr/","section":"publication","summary":"Smartphone apps allow retailers to track the location of their customers and provide the opportunity to reach them with location-based mobile ads.

A process of moderated serial mediation demonstrates indirect positive effects of ad openness on brand choice (via intrusiveness and Aad), moderated by location congruency.

It is known that the unhealthy habits of children can cause unavoidable side effects in their early stage of life, including both physical and mental consequences. This work considers that the physical activity level of children is a behaviour that can be spread throughout the social relations of children in their daily life at school. Therefore, the aim of this work is to define what the best strategy is to find ’targets’ (i.e., influential children that can initiate behavioural change) for physical activity (PA) interventions that would affect the average PA of a population of Dutch school classes. We tuned a model based on the influence of the children’s peers in their social network, based on the data set from the MyMovez project – Phase I. Five intervention strategies were implemented, and their efficacy was compared. Once the targets were chosen, an increase of 17% was applied to their initial PA. Then, the diffusion model was run to verify the improvement on the PA of the whole network after one year. We discuss implications of the simulation results on which strategies may be used to make informed choices about the setup of social network interventions and future model improvements. Our results show that targeting more vulnerable children (i.e. in a worse environment) and applying a network optimization algorithm are the best solutions for this data set indicating that future interventions should aim for these two strategies.","tags":["Social Network Analyses","Physical Activity","Simulations","Social Network Interventions"],"title":"Using Simulations for Exploring Interventions in Social Networks: Modeling Physical Activity Behaviour in Dutch School Classes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530136800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530136800,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["TJ van Woudenberg","KE Bevelander","WJ Burk","CR Smit","L Buijs","M Buijzen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524434400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524434400,"objectID":"5f0c7e8503d13457934ee52d9a05e46c","permalink":"/publication/sni_pilot/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sni_pilot/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study examined the effectiveness of a social network intervention to promote physical activity among adolescents.

They are surrounded by ‘social influence agents’ (i.e., role models such as family, friends and peers) that co-determine their dietary intake and physical activity. However, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on the implementation of a social network approach in health campaigns. The MyMovez research project aims to fill this gap by developing a method for effective social network campaign implementation. This protocol paper describes the design and methods of Phase I of the MyMovez project, aiming to unravel youth’s social network structures in combination with individual, psychosocial, and environmental factors related to energy intake and expenditure. In addition, the Wearable Lab is developed to enable an attractive and state-of-the-art way of collecting data and online campaign implementation via social networks. Phase I of the MyMovez project consists of a large-scale cross-sequential cohort study. In five waves during a 3-year period (2016-2018), data are collected about youth’s social network exposure, media consumption, socialization experiences, psychological determinants of behavior, physical environment, dietary intake (snacking and drinking behavior) and physical activity using the Wearable Lab. The Wearable Lab exists of a smartphone-based research application (app) connected to an activity tracking bracelet, that is developed throughout the duration of the project. It generates peer- and self-reported (e.g., sociometric data and surveys) and experience sampling data, social network beacon data, real-time physical activity data (i.e., steps and cycling), location information, photos and chat conversation data from the app’s social media platform Social Buzz.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Smartphones","Centrality"],"title":"Youth’s social network structures and peer influences: study protocol MyMovez project–Phase I","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510873200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510873200,"objectID":"1abf4433d68b9ec961cb324f6ebca3cc","permalink":"/talk/hepa17/","publishdate":"2017-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/hepa17/","section":"talk","summary":"The current study examined the effectiveness of a social network intervention to promote physical activity among adolescents. Social network interventions utilize the effects that peers have on each other to change behavior throughout the social network. These interventions typically identify a small number of individuals within social networks (i.e. influence agents), and train them to promote specific behaviors. The current intervention is characterized by two innovative aspects: the selection and the training of the influence agents. In previous studies, the selected influence agents were those in the network who received the most nominations. For friendship nominations, popular adolescents will receive more nominations from their peers. However, it is argued that popular adolescents often depend on the social norms of the network to remain popular, and therefore may be reluctant to change their behavior. Selecting adolescents who have close ties with all classmates might be more strategic. Second, previous studies used  face to face training, which makes the intervention difficult to carry out on a large scale. Therefore, this study contacts and trains de influence agents via smartphones, and keeps contact with the influence agents during the intervention. A total of 190 adolescents (46.32% boys; M age = 12.17, age range: 11-14 years) were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. Participants received a research smartphone to measure sociometrics and covariates, and an accelerometer to measure physical activity (steps per day) at baseline and during the intervention one month later. In the intervention condition, the influence agents were trained via the smartphone how they could promote physical activity among their classmates.A multi-level model tested the effectiveness of the intervention, controlling for clustering of the data within participants and days. No intervention effect was observed (b= .11, t(599.46) = 1.10, p =.27).This was the first study to test whether physical activity could be promoted via influential peers by using smartphones. Unfortunately, the intervention could not increase physical activity in adolescents. Next to other discussion points, the consequences of the smartphone based training and the selection criterion for the influence agents are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial Testing a Social Network Intervention to Promote Physical Activity Among Adolescents by using Smartphones","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510873200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510873200,"objectID":"111430f8c07d27e2954d111375c79d23","permalink":"/talk/ispah18/","publishdate":"2017-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ispah18/","section":"talk","summary":"The current study will examine the effectiveness of a short video (i.e. vlog) intervention to promote physical activity among adolescents.

However, LBA consists of two underlying constructs: a mobile (vs. point-of-sales) advertising medium and location congruency (vs. location incongruency). This study aims to disentangle these underlying constructs by showing that they differentially affect the efficacy of an ad. Using a virtual reality lab experiment, this study shows that location-congruent ads result in increased choice for the target brand as compared to location-incongruent ads, independent of medium type. However, in location-incongruent situations, mobile ads attracted more attention than point-of-sales display ads. The advantages of LBA thus do not seem to emanate from medium type, but rather from the congruency between the ad and product location. When the ad is received at a different location than the product, the mobile medium is able to enhance consumers’ ad attention.","tags":["Advertising","Location Based","Virtual Reality"],"title":"Disentangling location-based advertising: the effects of location congruency and medium type on consumers’ ad attention and brand choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"fa2afe1cf205d722eb00e9f92020c1a5","permalink":"/talk/ispah16/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ispah16/","section":"talk","summary":"Peers have an important influence on the physical activity of youngsters, because most physical activities require other peers as play partners. Experimental studies have corroborated this idea, while using artificial settings in which children had only one other interaction partner. However, youth’s activities and the number and type of interacting partners vary heavily throughout the day. Therefore, unobtrusive and continuous measures of physical activity and peer proximity are preferred to assess the full scope of the influence of peer interaction on physical activity. This study has 3 research aims: 1) investigating the overall effect of peer presence, 2) examining the influence of group size, and 3) assessing the effect of interaction frequency with peers on physical activity. This is done by handing out the Wearable Lab to 1,200 youngsters (9-15 years old): a smartphone with a custom-built research app and a wearable pedometer (Fitbit). Participants use the Wearable Lab for three separate weeks over a six month period (January 2016-June 2016). Physical activity is measured by the pedometer (steps and minutes MVPA) and GPS coordinates (cycling activities) and averaged to activity per 15 minutes. Peer proximity is measured by the research smartphones scanning for other participants’ phones that are within Bluetooth range (approximately 10 meters) every 15 minutes. Regression analyses and social network modeling will test 1) the effect of peer presence by comparing physical activity levels in a group setting compared to an individual setting, 2) the effect of group size by examining whether youth become more physically active when the group size of interacting peers increases and 3) the effect of interaction frequency with peers by analyzing whether participants are more physically active when they interact with peers whom they see more frequently, than peers whom they see less often.

Peers are an important determinant of physical activity in youngsters (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, \u0026 Cook, 2001) This study is particularly interested in the processes that explain the similarity in physical activity in adolescents’ friendships. More specifically, this study will examine changes in friendships and physical activity levels at three time points and test whether similarity in physical activity exists prior to the formation of friendships (selection), or whether friends become more similar over time (influence). To test for selection and influence effects of friendship networks, stochastic actor-based models will be used (Snijders, van de Bunt, \u0026 Steglich, 2010). Longitudinal social network analyses simultaneously investigate changes in friendships and physical activity, and are capable of disentangling whether friends select other’s based on physical activity and whether friends influence each other’s physical activity. In total, 394 youngsters (41% boys, age: 11-14 y/o) out of eight secondary school classes participated for three separate weeks between January and June of 2016. Physical activity was measured by wrist-worn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) for five days (M=8424.06 steps/day, SD =3595.37). Friendship was measured by asking participants to nominate their friends, via the research smartphone. Social network modelling revealed that, after controlling for network and same-sex selection effects, the selection effect was statistically significant (b=2.71, SE= 1.13, p=.017). This indicates that youngsters initiate friendships with others that have similar physical activity levels. In addition, a statistically significant influence effect was observed (b=.34, SE= .14, p=.017), which indicates that friends became increasingly similar in physical activity. The findings provided evidence for similarity in physical activity in youngsters. Youngsters who were not friends at the beginning of the study, but were similar in their physical activity level, were more likely to become friends at the end of the five-month period, than youngsters who were dissimilar in their physical activity. At the same time, youngsters who were already friends at the beginning of the study influenced the physical activity of their friends. Therefore, social network interventions might be preferable to individually oriented interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Similarity of physical activity in youngsters’ social networks: Selection or Influence?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"ea48274d59b22c168152a35ebceed0f8","permalink":"/talk/phd15/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd15/","section":"talk","summary":"Overweight and obesity are among the most common public health problems in Western Society. Energy intake and expenditure have been identified as major contributors to the obesity epidemic (i.e., Big Two; Salvy, de la Haye, Bowker \u0026 Herman, 2012). Many campaigns focusing on the prevention and reduction of child obesity have been developed and implemented. Unfortunately,  little effects were observed (Stice, Shaw, \u0026 Marti, 2006). A possible explanation for this is that prevention programs generally neglect the social context of the targeted individuals. However, individuals are surrounded by social influences that are co-determining the targeted behaviours (Cunningham et al., 2012; Patrick \u0026 Nicklas, 2005). Based on the diffusion of innovation theory (Valente2007; 2008; 2010), health campaigns can be improved by including the social context by targeting influence agents (i.e., social agents with a significant network position). Therefore, the aims of our projects are to design and implement a social network health campaign to promote physical activity among youth. For this study, we will make use of the Wearable Lab which consists of a smartphone and a fitness tracker. The aims of our projects are to investigate the most effective way to promote a healthy lifestyle, which influence agents we need to target and what kind influence mechanisms do they use. Based on these results, a combined intervention will be conducted among approximately 2500 youngsters (9-15 y/o) in the Netherlands.","tags":[],"title":"Social network implemented health campaign to promote physical activity among youth.","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"a795f10f43f0c5469609954463b8c7e2","permalink":"/talk/bsi17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bsi17/","section":"talk","summary":"The MyMovez project investigates how health campaigns can best be implemented among youth. We focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle among 9 to 15 year-olds. During this phase in life, important habits are being formed regarding eating and drinking, physical activity, and media use. To reveal the success and fail factors of health campaigns, we test several mobile health campaigns among 1.000 children and adolescents in a period of three years, and we will investigate the short and long-term effects on their eating and drinking, physical activity and media behaviors. At the core of the project is the power of youth’s social networks. Research shows that the social environment has great influence on a young person’s lifestyle: e.g. dietary intake, physical activity, and media use. In order to get a closer look into the lifestyle of the target group, the investigators created the Wearable Lab. The Wearable Lab consists of a smartphone in combination with an activity-tracking bracelet. The smartphone includes an application (the MyMovez app) that on the one hand collects health-related data from the participants, for example through daily quizzes, photo’s, location tracking and message board conversations. On the other hand, the app can spread health messages and campaigns. The activity-tracker measures the number of steps taken to get an impression of participant’s physical activity. In this presentation, Thabo will present a couple of studies in the first phase of the project on the basis of the physical activity data. First he will show the innovative features of the wearable lab and how they helped us answer new research questions. Second, he will dive into the social networks of the primary and secondary classrooms and show how physical activity spreads in social network. Lastly, he will illustrate the next phase of the project by showing a recently conducted pilot studies in which specific pupils received the task to promote physical activity among their peers.","tags":[],"title":"Social network intervention to promote physical activity in youth.","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"f6097941743e74a0ba61ec9b488bdbfa","permalink":"/talk/ica2015/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ica2015/","section":"talk","summary":"This study investigates how the feeling of being present in virtual reality is enhanced by psychological mechanisms.
