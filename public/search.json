Previous studies have shown that young people are more similar in physical activity to their friends than those who are not their friends (Long, Barrett, \u0026 Lockhart, 2017; Stearns et al., 2018). More specifically, children and adolescents both select new friends on the basis of physical activity and influence the amount of physical activity of friends (de la Haye, Robins, Mohr, \u0026 Wilson, 2011; Gesell, Tesdahl, \u0026 Ruchman, 2012). The current study is particularly interested in these two processes that explain the similarity between adolescents’ friendships in physical activity. More specifically, this study examined changes in nominated friendships and objectively measured physical activity levels at three time points and test whether similarity in physical activity exists prior to the formation of friendships (selection), or whether friends become more similar over time (influence). Methods: To test for selection and influence effects of friendship networks, stochastic actor-based models are used (i.e., RSiena; Snijders, van de Bunt, \u0026 Steglich, 2010). Longitudinal social network analysis simultaneously investigates changes in friendships and physical activity, and are capable of disentangling whether adolescents select friends based on a similar level of physical activity and whether friends influence each other’s physical activity. In total, 726 adolescents (47% male, Mage = 10.88, SDage = 1.16, range = 8-15 y/o) in 38 school classes participated for three separate weeks between February and June of 2018. Physical activity was measured by wrist-worn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) for five days (M = 9,669 steps/day, SD =2,872) and reduced to four categories (1-4). The friendship networks were determined based on the question “With whom in your class do you spend time during the breaks?” that participants received on the research smartphone. Results: Social network modelling revealed that, after controlling for endogenous network effects, both selection (b=.44, SE= .12) and influence (b=.18, SE= .06) effects were statistically significant. However, after controlling for the effects of sex, age and zBMI, the results slightly changed. The influence effect was still observed (b=.15, SE= .06), but the selection effect was not significant anymore (b=.23, SE= .14). Instead, the analysis suggest that adolescents select others as friends based on sex and zBMI. Together, these results indicates that adolescents do not initiate friendships with others that have similar physical activity levels but adolescents do become more similar in physical activity to that of their friends. Conclusions: Mostly in line with previous studies (de la Haye et al., 2011; Gesell et al., 2012; Long et al., 2017; Shoham et al., 2012; Simpkins, Schaefer, Price, \u0026 Vest, 2013), these findings show that friends are similarity in physical activity. That is, adolescents do not select friends based on similarity in physical activity, but do influence the physical activity of friends.","tags":[],"title":"Selection and Influence Effects on Physical Activity in Adolescents' Social Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594159200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594159200,"objectID":"065e907e7db1a31227b9fd85a79f3279","permalink":"/talk/ecda2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ecda2020/","section":"talk","summary":"In this presentation, prof.

It has been suggested that adolescents are more susceptible to peer norms than parental norms, because they experience a strong need for group acceptance that leads to conforming to peer group norms. The current study examined changes in snacking behavior and four types of social norms (i.e., parental and peer descriptive and injunctive norms) that promoted fruit and vegetable intake among adolescents. This study was the first to examine whether snacking behavior also influenced norm perceptions by testing the directionality of these associations.The study consisted of 819 participants (M [SD] age = 11.19 [1.36]; 46.1% boys), collected at three time points (T1 = 2016, T2 = 2017 and T3 = 2018) during the MyMovez project. Self-reported frequency of snack consumption, perceived parental and peer descriptive and injunctive norms were assessed. The primary analysis consisted of a series of cross-lagged autoregressive models specified in a structural equation modeling framework.Model comparisons testing the descriptive and injunctive norms in separate models and in an additional combined model revealed evidence for bi-directional associations between norms and snacking behavior. Descriptive peer and parent norms were not found to have an effect on subsequent snacking behaviors. Perceived injunctive parental norms were positively associated with healthy snack food intake and negatively associated with unhealthy snack intake (forward direction). Injunctive peer norms were negatively associated with healthy snack food intake. In addition, higher unhealthy snack food intake was negatively associated with the perception of descriptive and injunctive parental norms 1 year later (reversed direction). We did not find peer norms to be more closely associated with changes in snacking behaviors compared to parental norms. Parents expecting their children to snack healthy had a positive influence on healthy snacking behavior whereas only acting as a healthy role model did not. Future research should address the possible interaction between descriptive and injunctive norms. Research should also take into account the bi-directional relations between eating behaviors and normative perceptions.","tags":["Cross-lagged panel model","Snacking behavior","Social Norms"],"title":"Exploring the directionality in the relationship between descriptive and injunctive parental and peer norms and snacking behavior in a three-year-cross-lagged study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Scripts"],"content":"\rHi all!\nWhile I’m a writing this blog, I’m sitting in the train. Soaked… again. It has been raining for quite some weeks now and the weather report doesn’t give me much hope for the next weeks. I certainly don’t want to go outside to train for the half-marathon. To make myself a little less depressed, I think it is time for a new blog.\nIn this blog, I wanted to see whether I am the only one, or whether the kids in the MyMovez project sample also are less physically active on rainy days.\nBut before we start, first let is get in the mood by playing the sound on this website.\nThe data\rThe data of the project is publicly available, clickettyclickclick. In addition, the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) shares the day-to-day weather data on their website. For a conference poster, I downloaded the data from 27-01-2016 until 04-07-2018. This data is already merged to the physical activity data, so you don’t have to do this yourself.\nThe first step is to load the downloaded MyMovez data. More specifically, we unzip the file and only need the physical activity data that is stored in the folder “5. Fitbit data”.\rLet’s see what type of data we have here…\n## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --\r## v ggplot2 3.2.0 v purrr 0.3.2\r## v tibble 2.1.3 v dplyr 0.8.3\r## v tidyr 1.0.0 v stringr 1.4.0\r## v readr 1.3.1 v forcats 0.4.0\r## Warning: package \u0026#39;tidyr\u0026#39; was built under R version 3.6.2\r## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --\r## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\r## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()\r## number_of_dates\r## 1 224\r## Date\r## 1 2016-01-29\r## 2 2016-01-28\r## 3 2016-01-30\r## 4 2016-04-02\r## 5 2016-04-01\r## 6 2016-03-31\r## Date\r## 219 2018-04-16\r## 220 2018-05-23\r## 221 2018-03-21\r## 222 20-5-2018\r## 223 19-5-2018\r## 224 18-5-2018\rApparently, there is something wrong with three dates: 18-5-2018 until 20-5-2018 are stored in a different format.

For this we will use the lubridate package.\nlibrary(lubridate)\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;lubridate\u0026#39;\r## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;:\r## ## date\rFB \u0026lt;- FB %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(LDate = lubridate::date(Date))\rFB %\u0026gt;% select(LDate) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(begin = min(LDate),\rend = max(LDate))\r## begin end\r## 1 2016-01-27 2018-07-04\rIndeed the first day of data is 27th of January 2016 and the last date is the 4th of July in 2018.\n\rManipulating the data\rIn this blog, I want to make two new variables. One that informs us what year it is, the other the day number in that year. For example, 4th of July in 2018 is in the year 2018 (duh) and the 4th of July is the …\nlubridate::yday(\u0026quot;2018-07-04\u0026quot;)\r## [1] 185\r… 185th day of the year of course.

For that we first will take only the unique dates and there corresponding weather conditions.\nFB %\u0026gt;%\rdistinct(LDate, Wave, YearF, YDay, Temp_mean, Hours_sun, Prec_hours, Humid) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_col(aes(x = YDay, y = Prec_hours), fill = \u0026quot;darkblue\u0026quot;, alpha = .6) +\rgeom_point(aes(x = YDay, y = Hours_sun), color = \u0026quot;darkgoldenrod1\u0026quot;, alpha = .6) +\rgeom_smooth(aes (x = YDay, y = Temp_mean, colour = as.factor(Wave)), alpha = .6, span = 1, method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, se = FALSE) +\rfacet_grid(rows = vars(YearF)) +\rggtitle (\u0026quot;Weather conditions per day number per year\u0026quot;) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;Day of the year\u0026quot;) + ylab (\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(colour = \u0026quot;Wave\u0026quot;) +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\rThe blue bars represent the hours of precipitation (a fancy word for rain). The yellow dots represent the sun, at least the number of hours that you could see the sun shine. The colored lines are the regression lines of the mean temperature per wave. We are now in March (around day number 70), so it is nice to see that the average temperature will go up in the end.\n\rPhysical Activity\rNow let’s add the physical activity data. More specifically, lets add the average number of steps per day. In order to do this, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviations of steps per day. In addition, I divided the number of steps by 1000 so it is number of K steps per day. To keep the graphic a clear, I have excluded the average temperature and created a smooth line of the mean physical activity.\n\rFB %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(Imputed == \u0026quot;observed\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # only use the observed data\rgroup_by(Wave, YearF, YDay, Hours_sun, Prec_hours) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(StepsK_mean = mean(Steps)/1000,\rStepsK_sd = sd(Steps)/1000) %\u0026gt;%\rungroup() %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_col(aes(x = YDay, y = Prec_hours), fill = \u0026quot;darkblue\u0026quot;, alpha = .6) +\rgeom_point(aes(x = YDay, y = Hours_sun), color = \u0026quot;darkgoldenrod1\u0026quot;, alpha = .6) +\rgeom_smooth(aes (x = YDay, y = StepsK_mean, colour = as.factor(Wave)), alpha = .6, span = 1, method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;, se = FALSE) +\rfacet_grid(rows = vars(YearF)) +\rggtitle (\u0026quot;Physical activity and weather conditions over the three year\u0026quot;) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;Day of the year\u0026quot;) + ylab (\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(colour = \u0026quot;Wave\u0026quot;) +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\rAs you can observe, the weather (at least hours of sun and rain) seem to predict psychical activity in Wave 3 and perhaps also in wave 4. Fortunately we have the data and we can test whether the weather has an effect on adolescents physical activity.\nBecause we have multiple measures per participant and the participants are nested in classrooms, we will use a mixed effects model to control for the clustering of the data. But first, we want to make sure that the data is normally distributed. Therefore we use the Shapiro-Wilk’s test and print out the histogram of the mean minutes of MVPA. The null hypothesis of the Shapiro-Wilk’s test is that the data is normally distributed. As you can see, the plot looks sort of normally distributed, but this is not the case according to a significant Shapiro-Wilk’s test.\nFB2\u0026lt;-FB %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(Imputed == \u0026quot;observed\u0026quot; \u0026amp; Steps \u0026gt;999) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(Child) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(StepsK_mean = mean(Steps)/1000) %\u0026gt;%\rungroup()\rhist(FB2$StepsK_mean)\r\rshapiro.test(FB2$StepsK_mean)\r## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test\r## ## data: FB2$StepsK_mean\r## W = 0.97592, p-value = 1.2e-14\r\rMixed effects model with lme4\rWe should fix that, but we are not going to do this now.

Also a negative effect of the hours of rain per day. Let’s make four graphs based on these results.\n\rVisualize the separate effects.\rFirst up, the effect of the mean temperature. The alpha of the points in the graph is set to the number of observations that is used to calculate the average score. So the higher the alpha (the more visible the dot), the more data is used. I have added a grey geom_smooth with a grey line and a red line. The red line is the regression coefficient the grey follows the data. This indicates that this effect is not a perfect linear function and seems to weaken after 20 degrees. Which makes sense, because then it will become too hot to be physically active. Second, I have made a similar plot for the effect of the hours of sunshine, that provides a similar pattern.\nHere we observe the same pattern. This does make sense as I can image than these two variables are correlated. However, when we check in the lme4 output, we see that there was a negative correlation between those two (when controlled for the other variables). Let’s investigate this.\nAre the two variables normally distributed?\nFB3\u0026lt;-FB %\u0026gt;%\rdistinct(LDate, Temp_mean, Hours_sun)\rhist(FB3$Temp_mean)\rshapiro.test(FB3$Temp_mean)\r## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test\r## ## data: FB3$Temp_mean\r## W = 0.97645, p-value = 0.0009455\rhist(FB3$Hours_sun)\rshapiro.test(FB3$Hours_sun)\r## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test\r## ## data: FB3$Hours_sun\r## W = 0.94282, p-value = 0.0000001244\rNope!

Both very low and very high humid days predict less physical activity. The regression line is almost flat.\nAnd the last plot, the plot that I anticipated, the effect of the rain on physical activity:\nSo there you have it. The more it rains, the less physically active the kids in the MyMovez sample are.

A promising alternative is to carry out social network interventions. In social network interventions, a small group of individuals (influence agents) is selected to promote health-related behaviors within their social network. This study investigates whether a social network intervention is more effective to promote physical activity, compared to a mass media intervention and no intervention. Adolescents (N = 446; Mage = 11.35, SDage = 1.34; 47% male) were randomly allocated by classroom (N = 26, in 11 schools) to one of three conditions: social network intervention, mass media intervention, or control condition. In the social network intervention, 15% of the participants (based on peer nominations) was approached to become an influence agent, who created vlogs about physical activity that were shown during the intervention. In the mass media intervention, participants were exposed to vlogs made by unfamiliar peers (i.e., vlogs of the social network intervention). The control condition did not receive vlogs about physical activity. All participants received a research smartphone to complete questionnaires and a wrist-worn accelerometer to measure physical activity. The trial was registered a priori in the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR6903). There were no differences in objectively measured physical activity between this social network intervention and the control condition in the short-term, but there was an unexpected increase in the control condition compared to the social network intervention in the long-term. No differences between the social network intervention and mass media intervention were observed. The current study does not provide evidence that this social network intervention is effective in increasing physical activity in adolescents. Exploratory analyses suggest that this social network intervention increased the perceived social norm toward physical activity and responses to the vlogs were more positive in the social network intervention than in the mass media intervention. These initial results warrant further research to investigate the role of the social norms and the added benefit of using influence agents for social network interventions.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Adolescents","Vlogs"],"title":"Testing a Social Network Intervention Using Vlogs to Promote Physical Activity Among Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TJ van Woudenberg","KE Bevelander","WJ Burk","CR Smit","L Buijs","M Buijzen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578610800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578610800,"objectID":"aa6aecad41c9237a82864ab551abee37","permalink":"/publication/beacon/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/beacon/","section":"publication","summary":"Technological progress has enabled researchers to use new unobtrusive measures of relationships between actors in social network analysis. However, research on how these unobtrusive measures of peer connections relate to traditional sociometric nominations in adolescents is scarce. Therefore, the current study compared traditional peer nominated networks with more unobtrusive measures of peer connections: Communication networks that consist of instant messages in an online social platform and proximity networks based on smartphones’ Bluetooth signals that measure peer proximity. The three social network types were compared in their coverage, stability, overlap, and the extent to which the networks exhibit the often observed sex segregation in adolescent social networks. Method: Two samples were derived from the MyMovez project: a longitudinal sample of 444 adolescents who participated in the first three waves of the first year of the project (Y1; 51% male; Mage = 11.29, SDage = 1.26) and a cross-sectional sample of 774 adolescents that participated in fifth wave in the third year (Y3; 48% male; Mage = 10.76, SDage = 1.23). In the project, all participants received a research smartphone and a wrist-worn accelerometer. On the research smartphone, participants received daily questionnaires such as peer nomination questions (i.e., nominated network). In addition, the smartphone automatically scanned for other smartphones via Bluetooth signal every 15 minutes of the day (i.e., proximity network). In the Y3 sample, the research smartphone also had a social platform in which participants could send messages to each other (i.e., communication network). Results: The results show that nominated networks provided data for the most participants compared to the other two networks, but in these networks, participants had the lowest number of connections with peers. Nominated networks showed to be more stable over time compared to proximity or communication networks. That is, more connections remained the same in nominated networks than in proximity networks over the three waves of Y1. The overlap between the three networks was rather small, indicating that the networks measured different types of connections. Nominated and communication networks were segregated by sex, whereas this was less the case in proximity networks. Conclusion: The communication and proximity networks seem to be promising unobtrusive measures of peer connections and are less of a burden to the participant compared to a nominated network. However, given the structural differences between the networks and the number of connections per wave, the communication and proximity networks should not be used as direct substitutes for sociometric nominations,  and researchers should bear in mind what type of connections they wish to assess.","tags":["Social Networks","Nominated","BLuetooth","Communication","Physical Activity"],"title":"Comparing the measurement of different social networks: Peer nominations, online communication, and proximity data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577871900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577871900,"objectID":"831146a6b808f61a87040b03595123af","permalink":"/talk/etmaal2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T10:45:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/etmaal2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Peers are an important determinant of physical activity in children and adolescents (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, \u0026 Cook, 2001). Previous studies have shown that young people are more similar in physical activity to their friends than those who are not their friends (Long, Barrett, \u0026 Lockhart, 2017; Stearns et al., 2018). More specifically, children and adolescents both select new friends on the basis of physical activity and influence the amount of physical activity of friends (de la Haye, Robins, Mohr, \u0026 Wilson, 2011; Gesell, Tesdahl, \u0026 Ruchman, 2012). The current study is particularly interested in these two processes that explain the similarity between adolescents’ friendships in physical activity. More specifically, this study examined changes in nominated friendships and objectively measured physical activity levels at three time points and test whether similarity in physical activity exists prior to the formation of friendships (selection), or whether friends become more similar over time (influence). To test for selection and influence effects of friendship networks, stochastic actor-based models are used (i.e., RSiena; Snijders, van de Bunt, \u0026 Steglich, 2010). Longitudinal social network analysis simultaneously investigates changes in friendships and physical activity, and are capable of disentangling whether adolescents select friends based on a similar level of physical activity and whether friends influence each other’s physical activity. In total, 726 adolescents (47% male, Mage = 10.88, SDage = 1.16, range = 8-15 y/o) in 38 school classes participated for three separate weeks between February and June of 2018. Physical activity was measured by wrist-worn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) for five days (M = 9,669 steps/day, SD =2,872), and reduced to four categories. The friends networks were determined based on the question “With whom in your class do you spend time during the breaks?” on the research smartphone. Social network modelling revealed that, after controlling for endogenous network effects, both selection (b=.44, SE= .12) and influence (b=.18, SE= .06) effects were statistically significant. However, after controlling for the effects of sex, age and zBMI, the results slightly changed. The influence effect was still observed (b=.15, SE= .06), but the selection effect was not significant anymore (b=.23, SE= .14). Instead, the analysis suggest that adolescents select each other based on sex and zBMI. Together, these results  indicates that adolescents do not initiate friendships with others that have similar physical activity levels but friends do become more similar in physical activity to that of their friends.Mostly in line with previous studies (de la Haye et al., 2011; Gesell et al., 2012; Long et al., 2017; Shoham et al., 2012; Simpkins, Schaefer, Price, \u0026 Vest, 2013), these findings show that friends are similarity in physical activity. That is, adolescents do not select friends based on similarity in physical activity, but do influence the physical activity of friends.","tags":[],"title":"Selection and Influence Effects on Physical Activity in Adolescents’ Social Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Scripts"],"content":"\rHi all!\nI while ago, I had the problem that I wanted to compare the edges between two different time points, but also the edges of different types of networks.

However, designing successful social network interventions is a considerable research challenge. In this study, we rely on social network analysis and agent-based simulations to better understand and capitalize on the complex interplay of social networks and health behaviors. More specifically, we investigate criteria for selecting influence agents that can be expected to produce the most successful social network health interventions.Objective: The aim of this study was to test which selection criterion to determine influence agents in a social network intervention resulted in the biggest increase in physical activity in the social network. To test the differences among the selection criteria, a computational model was used to simulate different social network interventions and observe the intervention’s effect on the physical activity of primary and secondary school children within their school classes. As a next step, this study relied on the outcomes of the simulated interventions to investigate whether social network interventions are more effective in some classes than others based on network characteristics.Methods: We used a previously validated agent-based model to understand how physical activity spreads in social networks and who was influencing the spread of behavior. From the observed data of 460 participants collected in 26 school classes, we simulated multiple social network interventions with different selection criteria for the influence agents (ie, in-degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and random influence agents) and a control condition (ie, no intervention). Subsequently, we investigated whether the detected variation of an intervention’s success within school classes could be explained by structural characteristics of the social networks (ie, network density and network centralization).Results: The 1-year simulations showed that social network interventions were more effective compared with the control condition (beta=.30; t100=3.23; P=.001).

In social network interventions, a small group of influential individuals (influence agents) is selected to promote health behaviors within their social network. However, no previous social network intervention study has investigated whether a social network intervention is more effective than a mass media campaign or no intervention. Adolescents (N = 446; Mage = 11.35 (SD = 1.34); 47.31% male) were randomly allocated by classroom (N = 26) to one of three conditions: social network intervention, mass media intervention or control condition. In the social network intervention, 15% of the participants was selected to be an influence based on peer nominations (on closeness centrality) and were asked to create several vlogs about physical activity. During the intervention period, participants in the social network condition were able to view the vlogs on a research smartphone. In the mass media intervention, participants were exposed to vlogs made by unfamiliar peers (i.e., the vlogs of the social network intervention). All participants received a research smartphone to complete questionnaires and a wrist-worn accelerometer to measure physical activity. Mixed effect models were us to account for the clustering of data per participant, per day, and per classroom. The analyses showed that there was an overal increase in physical activity druing the intervention. However, no differences were observed between the social network intervention and the control condition in the short-term, and an unexpected increase in the control condition compared to the social network intervention in the long-term. Also no differences between the social network intervention and mass media intervention were observed. In addition, exploratory analyses suggest that descriptive norms involving physical activity increased in the social network intervention and decreased in the mass media intervention. Also, participants in the social network intervention watched the vlogs more often and for a longer period, than participants in the mass media intervention that. The current study was the first study to test the additional benefit of implementing a social network approach the promote physical activity in adolescents by comparting a social network intervention to a mass media intervention and no intervention. The results do not provide evidence that the social network intervention was more effective in increasing physical activity in adolescents. Compared to other social network interventions, the current study did not train the influence agents how they could promote physical activity in the class, but merely showed them how they could create vlogs. Perhaps, a key factor to the effectiveness of social network interventions is a training of the influence agents.","tags":[],"title":"Promoting Adolescents Physical Activity through Social Network Interventions","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542409200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542409200,"objectID":"9f9d2d579bd66991f43e01ed47a5a03c","permalink":"/talk/prague19/","publishdate":"2018-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/prague19/","section":"talk","summary":"Social network interventions targeted at adolescents can have a substantial effect on their physical activity. However, designing successful social network interventions is a considerable research challenge. For example, it is unclear which criteria should be used to select influence agents that serve as promoters of the health behaviour. Investigating this through field experiments is an infeasible process. Fortunately, advancements in computer science enable us to simulate these complex processes. In this study, we investigate which criteria for selecting influence agents can be expected to produce the most successful social network interventions. The aim is to use a computational model to simulate different selection criteria for social network interventions and to observe the intervention's effect on the physical activity of primary and secondary school children. Based on the observed data of 460 participants collected in 26 school classes, we simulated multiple social network interventions ranging in selection criteria for the influence agents (i.e. in-degree, betweenness and closeness centrality and random influence agents) and a control condition (i.e. no intervention condition). Subsequently, we investigated whether the detected variation of an intervention’s success within school classes could be explained by structural characteristics of the social networks (i.e. network density and network centralization). The one-year simulations showed that the social network interventions were more effective compared to the control condition, β = .30, t(100) = 3.23, P = .001. In addition, the social network interventions that used a measure of centrality to select influence agents outperformed the random influence agent intervention, β = .46, t(100) = 3.86, P ","tags":[],"title":"Simulated Social Network Interventions to Promote Physical Activity: Who Should Be the Influence Agents?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["CR Smit","RNH de Leeuw","KE Bevelander","WJ Burk","L Buijs","TJ van Woudenberg","M Buijzen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539813600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539813600,"objectID":"97f2aff4d974d2922f0258029cc83462","permalink":"/publication/integrated_model_of_fruit/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/integrated_model_of_fruit/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested an integrated model for why young adolescents consume fruit, vegetables, and water. The model was based on evidence from studies applying three dominant theoretical approaches, including planned behavior, social norms, and intrinsic motivation. METHOD:The integrated model was tested with structural equation modeling using four data-collection waves of the MyMovez Project (MyMovez, 2017) in which 953 young adolescents (53.9% girls; Mage = 11.19, SDage = 1.36) participated. Self-reported measures were used to assess young adolescents' fruit, vegetable, and water consumption, self-efficacy, attitude, social norms of parents and peers, behavioral intentions, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS:The analyses revealed that young adolescents' intrinsic motivation to eat fruits and vegetables or drink water predicted changes in their fruit, vegetable, and water consumption. Furthermore, adolescents' perceived descriptive norm of parents (i.e., perception of the prevalence of their parents' water consumption) also predicted changes, but only for water consumption. CONCLUSION:The current findings show that young adolescents' intrinsic motivation (and, to some extent, parental social norms) is the strongest predictor of their consumption of fruit, vegetables, and water. It is important to note, behavioral intentions do not predict their actual behavior over time. Consequently, interventions should focus on increasing young adolescents' intrinsic motivation to perform the targeted behavior while incorporating the influence of the social context.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Smartphones","Centrality"],"title":"An integrated model of fruit, vegetable, and water intake in young adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Ketelaar","S Bernritter","TJ van Woudenberg","E Rozendaal","R Konig","J Vantriet","A Hühn","MS van Gisbergen","L Janssen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533074400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533074400,"objectID":"9bd4444de45d4368b87b3c5ee6c4c78d","permalink":"/publication/open_vr/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/open_vr/","section":"publication","summary":"Smartphone apps allow retailers to track the location of their customers and provide the opportunity to reach them with location-based mobile ads.

It is known that the unhealthy habits of children can cause unavoidable side effects in their early stage of life, including both physical and mental consequences. This work considers that the physical activity level of children is a behaviour that can be spread throughout the social relations of children in their daily life at school. Therefore, the aim of this work is to define what the best strategy is to find ’targets’ (i.e., influential children that can initiate behavioural change) for physical activity (PA) interventions that would affect the average PA of a population of Dutch school classes. We tuned a model based on the influence of the children’s peers in their social network, based on the data set from the MyMovez project – Phase I. Five intervention strategies were implemented, and their efficacy was compared. Once the targets were chosen, an increase of 17% was applied to their initial PA. Then, the diffusion model was run to verify the improvement on the PA of the whole network after one year. We discuss implications of the simulation results on which strategies may be used to make informed choices about the setup of social network interventions and future model improvements. Our results show that targeting more vulnerable children (i.e. in a worse environment) and applying a network optimization algorithm are the best solutions for this data set indicating that future interventions should aim for these two strategies.","tags":["Social Network Analyses","Physical Activity","Simulations","Social Network Interventions"],"title":"Using Simulations for Exploring Interventions in Social Networks: Modeling Physical Activity Behaviour in Dutch School Classes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530136800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530136800,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["TJ van Woudenberg","KE Bevelander","WJ Burk","CR Smit","L Buijs","M Buijzen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524434400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524434400,"objectID":"5f0c7e8503d13457934ee52d9a05e46c","permalink":"/publication/sni_pilot/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sni_pilot/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study examined the effectiveness of a social network intervention to promote physical activity among adolescents.

They are surrounded by ‘social influence agents’ (i.e., role models such as family, friends and peers) that co-determine their dietary intake and physical activity. However, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on the implementation of a social network approach in health campaigns. The MyMovez research project aims to fill this gap by developing a method for effective social network campaign implementation. This protocol paper describes the design and methods of Phase I of the MyMovez project, aiming to unravel youth’s social network structures in combination with individual, psychosocial, and environmental factors related to energy intake and expenditure. In addition, the Wearable Lab is developed to enable an attractive and state-of-the-art way of collecting data and online campaign implementation via social networks. Phase I of the MyMovez project consists of a large-scale cross-sequential cohort study. In five waves during a 3-year period (2016-2018), data are collected about youth’s social network exposure, media consumption, socialization experiences, psychological determinants of behavior, physical environment, dietary intake (snacking and drinking behavior) and physical activity using the Wearable Lab. The Wearable Lab exists of a smartphone-based research application (app) connected to an activity tracking bracelet, that is developed throughout the duration of the project. It generates peer- and self-reported (e.g., sociometric data and surveys) and experience sampling data, social network beacon data, real-time physical activity data (i.e., steps and cycling), location information, photos and chat conversation data from the app’s social media platform Social Buzz.","tags":["Social Network Intervention","Physical Activity","Smartphones","Centrality"],"title":"Youth’s social network structures and peer influences: study protocol MyMovez project–Phase I","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510873200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510873200,"objectID":"1abf4433d68b9ec961cb324f6ebca3cc","permalink":"/talk/hepa17/","publishdate":"2017-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/hepa17/","section":"talk","summary":"The current study examined the effectiveness of a social network intervention to promote physical activity among adolescents. Social network interventions utilize the effects that peers have on each other to change behavior throughout the social network. These interventions typically identify a small number of individuals within social networks (i.e. influence agents), and train them to promote specific behaviors. The current intervention is characterized by two innovative aspects: the selection and the training of the influence agents. In previous studies, the selected influence agents were those in the network who received the most nominations. For friendship nominations, popular adolescents will receive more nominations from their peers. However, it is argued that popular adolescents often depend on the social norms of the network to remain popular, and therefore may be reluctant to change their behavior. Selecting adolescents who have close ties with all classmates might be more strategic. Second, previous studies used  face to face training, which makes the intervention difficult to carry out on a large scale. Therefore, this study contacts and trains de influence agents via smartphones, and keeps contact with the influence agents during the intervention. A total of 190 adolescents (46.32% boys; M age = 12.17, age range: 11-14 years) were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. Participants received a research smartphone to measure sociometrics and covariates, and an accelerometer to measure physical activity (steps per day) at baseline and during the intervention one month later.

However, in location-incongruent situations, mobile ads attracted more attention than point-of-sales display ads.

Experimental studies have corroborated this idea, while using artificial settings in which children had only one other interaction partner. However, youth’s activities and the number and type of interacting partners vary heavily throughout the day. Therefore, unobtrusive and continuous measures of physical activity and peer proximity are preferred to assess the full scope of the influence of peer interaction on physical activity. This study has 3 research aims: 1) investigating the overall effect of peer presence, 2) examining the influence of group size, and 3) assessing the effect of interaction frequency with peers on physical activity. This is done by handing out the Wearable Lab to 1,200 youngsters (9-15 years old): a smartphone with a custom-built research app and a wearable pedometer (Fitbit). Participants use the Wearable Lab for three separate weeks over a six month period (January 2016-June 2016). Physical activity is measured by the pedometer (steps and minutes MVPA) and GPS coordinates (cycling activities) and averaged to activity per 15 minutes. Peer proximity is measured by the research smartphones scanning for other participants’ phones that are within Bluetooth range (approximately 10 meters) every 15 minutes. Regression analyses and social network modeling will test 1) the effect of peer presence by comparing physical activity levels in a group setting compared to an individual setting, 2) the effect of group size by examining whether youth become more physically active when the group size of interacting peers increases and 3) the effect of interaction frequency with peers by analyzing whether participants are more physically active when they interact with peers whom they see more frequently, than peers whom they see less often.

Peers are an important determinant of physical activity in youngsters (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, \u0026 Cook, 2001) This study is particularly interested in the processes that explain the similarity in physical activity in adolescents’ friendships. More specifically, this study will examine changes in friendships and physical activity levels at three time points and test whether similarity in physical activity exists prior to the formation of friendships (selection), or whether friends become more similar over time (influence). To test for selection and influence effects of friendship networks, stochastic actor-based models will be used (Snijders, van de Bunt, \u0026 Steglich, 2010). Longitudinal social network analyses simultaneously investigate changes in friendships and physical activity, and are capable of disentangling whether friends select other’s based on physical activity and whether friends influence each other’s physical activity. In total, 394 youngsters (41% boys, age: 11-14 y/o) out of eight secondary school classes participated for three separate weeks between January and June of 2016. Physical activity was measured by wrist-worn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) for five days (M=8424.06 steps/day, SD =3595.37). Friendship was measured by asking participants to nominate their friends, via the research smartphone. Social network modelling revealed that, after controlling for network and same-sex selection effects, the selection effect was statistically significant (b=2.71, SE= 1.13, p=.017). This indicates that youngsters initiate friendships with others that have similar physical activity levels. In addition, a statistically significant influence effect was observed (b=.34, SE= .14, p=.017), which indicates that friends became increasingly similar in physical activity. The findings provided evidence for similarity in physical activity in youngsters. Youngsters who were not friends at the beginning of the study, but were similar in their physical activity level, were more likely to become friends at the end of the five-month period, than youngsters who were dissimilar in their physical activity. At the same time, youngsters who were already friends at the beginning of the study influenced the physical activity of their friends. Therefore, social network interventions might be preferable to individually oriented interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Similarity of physical activity in youngsters’ social networks: Selection or Influence?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"ea48274d59b22c168152a35ebceed0f8","permalink":"/talk/phd15/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd15/","section":"talk","summary":"Overweight and obesity are among the most common public health problems in Western Society. Energy intake and expenditure have been identified as major contributors to the obesity epidemic (i.e., Big Two; Salvy, de la Haye, Bowker \u0026 Herman, 2012). Many campaigns focusing on the prevention and reduction of child obesity have been developed and implemented. Unfortunately,  little effects were observed (Stice, Shaw, \u0026 Marti, 2006). A possible explanation for this is that prevention programs generally neglect the social context of the targeted individuals. However, individuals are surrounded by social influences that are co-determining the targeted behaviours (Cunningham et al., 2012; Patrick \u0026 Nicklas, 2005). Based on the diffusion of innovation theory (Valente2007; 2008; 2010), health campaigns can be improved by including the social context by targeting influence agents (i.e., social agents with a significant network position). Therefore, the aims of our projects are to design and implement a social network health campaign to promote physical activity among youth. For this study, we will make use of the Wearable Lab which consists of a smartphone and a fitness tracker. The aims of our projects are to investigate the most effective way to promote a healthy lifestyle, which influence agents we need to target and what kind influence mechanisms do they use. Based on these results, a combined intervention will be conducted among approximately 2500 youngsters (9-15 y/o) in the Netherlands.","tags":[],"title":"Social network implemented health campaign to promote physical activity among youth.","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"a795f10f43f0c5469609954463b8c7e2","permalink":"/talk/bsi17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bsi17/","section":"talk","summary":"The MyMovez project investigates how health campaigns can best be implemented among youth. We focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle among 9 to 15 year-olds. During this phase in life, important habits are being formed regarding eating and drinking, physical activity, and media use. To reveal the success and fail factors of health campaigns, we test several mobile health campaigns among 1.000 children and adolescents in a period of three years, and we will investigate the short and long-term effects on their eating and drinking, physical activity and media behaviors. At the core of the project is the power of youth’s social networks. Research shows that the social environment has great influence on a young person’s lifestyle: e.g. dietary intake, physical activity, and media use. In order to get a closer look into the lifestyle of the target group, the investigators created the Wearable Lab. The Wearable Lab consists of a smartphone in combination with an activity-tracking bracelet. The smartphone includes an application (the MyMovez app) that on the one hand collects health-related data from the participants, for example through daily quizzes, photo’s, location tracking and message board conversations. On the other hand, the app can spread health messages and campaigns. The activity-tracker measures the number of steps taken to get an impression of participant’s physical activity. In this presentation, Thabo will present a couple of studies in the first phase of the project on the basis of the physical activity data. First he will show the innovative features of the wearable lab and how they helped us answer new research questions. Second, he will dive into the social networks of the primary and secondary classrooms and show how physical activity spreads in social network. Lastly, he will illustrate the next phase of the project by showing a recently conducted pilot studies in which specific pupils received the task to promote physical activity among their peers.","tags":[],"title":"Social network intervention to promote physical activity in youth.","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"f6097941743e74a0ba61ec9b488bdbfa","permalink":"/talk/ica2015/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ica2015/","section":"talk","summary":"This study investigates how the feeling of being present in virtual reality is enhanced by psychological mechanisms. More specifically, we examine (1) whether involvement with a virtual reality game and transportation into the narrative induce feelings of presence and (2) how variations in narratives can enhance these psychological mechanisms leading to presence. In a virtual reality lab setting 160 participants heard one of several narratives and played an unsolvable puzzle. Afterwards, participants filled out a questionnaire measuring the amount of presence in the virtual environment, involvement with the game, and transportation into the narrative. As hypothesized, transportation into the narrative predicted involvement with the game, which in turn predicted feelings of presence. In addition, chronological narratives elicited more transportation than disrupted narratives. These results are of interest to virtual reality game developers, and may be applied to other applications of virtual realities, like virtual studies or simulations for instruction purposes.","tags":[],"title":"To Be There, or Not To Be There: Transportation, Involvement, and Presence in Virtual Reality","type":"talk"}]
