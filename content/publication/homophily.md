More specifically, Longitudinal social network analsysis was used to test similairy and assess selection and influence processess in friendship networks simulationiesly. Stochastic actor based models (Siena) indicated that both processess do occur. However, after controling for the participants sex, age and BMI, only influences processes were observed.
